        <h3>Drinking water management (02/2019 – 02/2019)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed and developed a device that can detect absence or less
            drinking water and automatically order for the same through SMS to
            the local water supplier
          </li>

        <h3>Atmel development board (05/2018 – 07/2018)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed an Atmel development board which is based on Atmega 32A
            micro-controller and peripheral devises like 16X2 LCD display,
            buzzer, led and for input tactile switch and rotary encoder.
            Designed and manufactured the PCB for development board at home.

        <h3>Line following Robot Development (05/2017 – 06/2018)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed line following robot based on the control algorithm like
            PID for better control and speed.
          </li>

        <h3>Smart Water Analysis (08/2018 – 11/2018)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designed and developed a device which can detect pH and TDS of water
            and send this values to thingspeak server using WIFImodule like
            esp8266 and GSM module like SIM800
